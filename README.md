# Ultrasonic-Sensor

## Summary 
The project uses Assembler and C language and will compare how effectively the two languages can interface to an external device using Atmel Studio 7.0 and the ATmega32A microcontroller on an OUSB-IO board.

## Further Information
This project involves the design and programming of a system that will use a Parallax Ultrasonic Distance Sensor to accurately measure the distance of an object up to 3m. The sensor emits a 40kHz ultrasonic tone, which is not audible to the human ear; it can only detect 20 â€“ 20,000 Hz frequencies. Since the sensor uses a high frequency sound wave to obtain data, and the speed of sound changes depending on temperature, this project assumes that the environment that the sensor will operate in is kept at a constant ambient temperature (approximately 20 degrees Celsius). Thus, this project is restricted to such conditions for accurate results.


The project will utilise both the Assembler and C language and will compare how effectively the two languages can achieve a complex task. The purpose of this project is to design, simulate, implement and test an interface to an external device using Atmel Studio 7.0 and the ATmega32A microcontroller on the OUSB-IO board. The OUSB-IO board itself consists of multiple general-purpose input and output ports, LEDs, DIP switches, RS-232 communication compatibility, and an ATmega32A microcontroller. It operates on a 5V input from a USB source and can supply 3.3-5V to attached peripherals.
